For this project we were tasked wth creating a Workday Scheduler that used both jQuery and Day.js to create time blocks that we could schedule events into. The timmeblocks would save events as persistent data to local storage, and retrieve them on page reload. Day.js was used to color code the time blocks based on the current time, and to save the date as a value in the header. Below are links to and screenshots of the deployed applicaiton.
